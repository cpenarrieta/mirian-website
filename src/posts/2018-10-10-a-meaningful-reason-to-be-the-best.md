When I made the decision of getting married, I never thought my life would change so much. My husband and I had a lot of plans but one of them was not moving out from Peru, our home country, and start all over again. But that is live, right? It takes you to very different paths.

We started talking about the idea of moving, at first, I didn’t like it, I didn’t want to move out from my comfort zone. We were doing ok, we had a nice apartment, good jobs. But we’ve always wanted more. And to achieve that we had to make some changes. It’s like Albert Einstein said:

> “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”

Another factor was that I had to choose between study a master or having children. If we moved away it was going to be harder for me to do both. At the end I chose to travel, gain some work experience and then having a family.

So, we decided to move to Vancouver, Canada. My husband found a very good program there. Meanwhile I was going to get a job. Nevertheless, in the process, when everything was almost ready, I got pregnant. At first it was a big shock, we were excited but scare, two very common feelings when you are moving out from your comfort zone.

There I was, moving to a different country, pregnant and very scared for all the changes that were happening in my live. I felt overwhelm for all those feelings. Although, I think life was preparing me for this moment. Being aware of my emotions and recognize the impact that was having in my life was the first step to make the best of my current situation.

I realized that is important for my baby to spend the first two years with her (yeah! It’s a girl). The decisions that I made now about my career path it would have one more factor to consider: my daughter. Which is so much better, because I feel that gives me something bigger to fight, a meaningful reason to be the best in what I do as a professional.

In that process, I found the Digital Marketing Nanodegree Program from Udacity that helps me achieve the goal I want: learn about a new career path that allows me to work from home. This program gives me the opportunity to study in my own timing and in the future being prepared to start my own business in Social Media. All this while I raise my baby.

I thank my daughter Clara for giving me the strength that I needed to start this new life and make the hard decision of being a full-time mom and still pursuing my dreams. At the end, I took the best path that I could chose: I chose life.
